## Solana Playground

Solana Playground (Solpg) is a browser based IDE that allows you to quickly
develop, deploy, and test Solana programs!

To get started, go to [https://beta.solpg.io/](https://beta.solpg.io/).

<Steps>

### Create Playground Wallet

If it is your first time using Solana Playground, you'll first need to create a
Playground Wallet.

Click on the red status indicator button labeled "Not connected" at the bottom
left of the screen, (optionally) save your wallet's keypair file to your
computer for backup, then click "Continue".

![solpg-wallet](/assets/docs/core/quickstart/solpg-wallet.png)

After your Playground Wallet is created, you will notice the bottom of the
window now states your wallet's address, your SOL balance, and the Solana
cluster you are connected to (devnet by default).

<Callout>
  Your Playground Wallet will be saved in your browser's local storage. Clearing
  your browser cache will remove your saved wallet.
</Callout>

To fund your Playground wallet with devnet SOL, run the following command in the
Playground terminal:

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
solana airdrop 5
```

Alternatively, you can use this [devnet faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

### Create Anchor Project

Next, click the "Create a new project" button on the left-side panel.

Enter a project name, select Anchor as the framework, then click the "Create"
button.

![solpg-anchor](/assets/docs/core/quickstart/solpg-anchor.png)

This will create a basic Anchor program that can be found in the `src/lib.rs`
file. You can learn more about the details of an Anchor program in the Core
concepts section of the docs.

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

// This is your program's public key and it will update
// automatically when you build the project.
declare_id!("11111111111111111111111111111111");

#[program]
mod hello_anchor {
    use super::*;
    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, data: u64) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.accounts.new_account.data = data;
        msg!("Changed data to: {}!", data); // Message will show up in the tx logs
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    // We must specify the space in order to initialize an account.
    // First 8 bytes are default account discriminator,
    // next 8 bytes come from NewAccount.data being type u64.
    // (u64 = 64 bits unsigned integer = 8 bytes)
    #[account(init, payer = signer, space = 8 + 8)]
    pub new_account: Account<'info, NewAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct NewAccount {
    data: u64
}
```

### Build and Deploy Program

To build the program, simply run `build` in the terminal. Building the program
will update the program address in `declare_id!()`. This is the on-chain address
of your program.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
build
```

Once the program is built, run `deploy` in the terminal to deploy the program to
the cluster (devnet by default). To deploy a program, SOL must be allocated to
the on-chain account that stores the program. If you do not have enough SOL, you
may need to first request an airdrop.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
deploy
```

You can also use the `Build` and `Deploy` buttons on the left-side panel.

![solpg-build-deploy](/assets/docs/core/quickstart/solpg-build-deploy.png)

### Test Program

Included with the starter code is a test file found in `tests/anchor.test.ts`.
This file demonstrates how to interact with the program from the client.

```ts filename="anchor.test.ts"
// No imports needed: web3, anchor, pg and more are globally available

describe("Test", () => {
  it("initialize", async () => {
    // Generate keypair for the new account
    const newAccountKp = new web3.Keypair();

    // Send transaction
    const data = new BN(42);
    const txHash = await pg.program.methods
      .initialize(data)
      .accounts({
        newAccount: newAccountKp.publicKey,
        signer: pg.wallet.publicKey,
        systemProgram: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
      })
      .signers([newAccountKp])
      .rpc();
    console.log(`Use 'solana confirm -v ${txHash}' to see the logs`);

    // Confirm transaction
    await pg.connection.confirmTransaction(txHash);

    // Fetch the created account
    const newAccount = await pg.program.account.newAccount.fetch(
      newAccountKp.publicKey,
    );

    console.log("On-chain data is:", newAccount.data.toString());

    // Check whether the data on-chain is equal to local 'data'
    assert(data.eq(newAccount.data));
  });
});
```

To run the test file once the program is deployed, run `test` in the terminal.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
test
```

You can also use the `Test` button on the left-side panel.

![solpg-test](/assets/docs/core/quickstart/solpg-test.png)

You should see output similar to the following:

```shell filename="Terminal"
Running tests...
  hello_anchor.test.ts:
  hello_anchor
    Use 'solana confirm -v TxUEWJXXjgbUcRHsevXNLGvCkWsCECyU6zhUyTmnyeX17eo49zH9Nr3BNuTPTSZGuRxeTJmm8qKGygm3qpP8Edu' to see the logs
    On-chain data is: 42
    âœ” initialize (961ms)
  1 passing (963ms)
$
```

You can then view the transaction logs by running the `solana confirm -v`
command and specifying the transaction hash from the test output:

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
solana confirm -v [TxHash]
```

Alternatively, you can view the transaction details on
[SolanaFM](https://solana.fm/) or
[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) by searching for
the TxHash.

<Callout>
  Reminder to update the cluster (network) connection on the Explorer you are
  using to match Solana Playground. The default cluster is devnet.
</Callout>

### Close Program

Lastly, the SOL allocated to the on-chain program can be fully recovered by
closing the program.

You can close a program by running the following command and specifying the
program ID found in `declare_id!()`:

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
solana program close [ProgramID]
```

Congratulations! You've just built and deployed your first Solana program using
the Anchor framework!

## Import from Github

Solana Playground offers a convenient feature allowing you to import or view
projects using their GitHub URLs.

Open this
[Solpg link](https://beta.solpg.io/https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/quickstart)
to view the Anchor project from this
[Github repo](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-examples/tree/main/quickstart).

Click the `Import` button and enter a project name to add it to your list of
projects in Solana Playground.

![solpg-import](/assets/docs/core/quickstart/solpg-import.png)

Once a project is imported, all changes are automatically saved and persisted
within the Playground environment.

Additionally, you have the option to import projects directly by clicking the
Github icon on the left-side panel.
